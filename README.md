# SpaceXMonitor

## What is this project about? ##

This app provides up-to-date information about SpaceX launches starting from 2021.
The main screen displays a list of missions with brief information about each mission: mission name, success, launch date, and more.
Detailed information about each mission is also available: the logo, the number of first stage reuses, and information about the crew.

## Why do I need this project? ##

This project gave me the opportunity to improve my android development skills. Namely:

- Kotlin skills when working with Lists and Arrays
- Understanding the concept of dependency injection, and applying it to an android application using the Hilt library
- Improved layout implementation skills according to the Material Design guidelines
- Improved understanding of the principles of the HTTP protocol, and how to work with it in the Retrofit2 library
- Made a migration from the Paging2 to the Paging3 library
- Applied the Coil library for loading images instead of the Glide

Also, this project keeps everyone up to date with current SpaceX events! :grinning:
